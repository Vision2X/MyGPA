# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview

Your application has been successfully configured to use Firebase Authentication instead of browser in-memory storage. This provides secure, scalable user authentication with various benefits including:

- Persistent authentication across sessions
- Secure password handling
- Built-in security features
- Email verification and password reset
- Scalable user management

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/lib/firebase.js`)

- Firebase app initialization
- Firebase Auth setup and export
- Secure configuration with your Firebase project credentials

### 2. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)

- **Login**: Email/password authentication via Firebase
- **Signup**: User registration with automatic profile creation
- **Logout**: Secure sign out
- **Password Reset**: Email-based password reset functionality
- **Profile Management**: Local profile storage with Firebase sync
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for all scenarios

### 3. Authentication Page (`src/pages/AuthPage.jsx`)

- Login form with email/password
- Signup form with name, email, password, and confirmation
- "Forgot Password" functionality with modal dialog
- Form validation and user feedback
- Loading states and error handling

## Key Features

### Firebase Authentication Features:

- âœ… Email/Password authentication
- âœ… Password reset via email
- âœ… Persistent authentication state
- âœ… Secure user sessions
- âœ… Firebase security rules enforcement

### Profile Management:

- âœ… User profiles stored locally (can be migrated to Firestore later)
- âœ… Profile synchronization with Firebase user data
- âœ… Profile updates with Firebase integration

### User Experience:

- âœ… Smooth authentication flow
- âœ… Comprehensive error messages
- âœ… Loading states during authentication
- âœ… Automatic redirection after login/signup
- âœ… Password visibility toggles
- âœ… Form validation

## Firebase Console Setup Required

To use the authentication features, you need to enable Email/Password authentication in your Firebase console:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `mygpa-app`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Email/Password** provider
5. Optionally enable **Email link (passwordless sign-in)** for enhanced UX

## Security Features

### Authentication Security:

- Passwords are never stored locally
- Firebase handles password hashing and security
- Secure token-based authentication
- Automatic session management

### Error Handling:

- User-friendly error messages
- Specific error codes for different scenarios
- Prevention of account enumeration attacks
- Rate limiting protection

## How It Works

### Login Process:

1. User enters email/password
2. Firebase validates credentials
3. On success, user profile is loaded/created
4. User is redirected to dashboard
5. Authentication state persists across sessions

### Signup Process:

1. User provides name, email, password
2. Firebase creates account
3. User profile is created locally
4. Display name is set in Firebase
5. User is automatically logged in

### Password Reset:

1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enters email address
3. Firebase sends password reset email
4. User follows email link to reset password

## Migration Benefits

### From Local Storage to Firebase:

- **Security**: No more plaintext passwords in localStorage
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of users
- **Reliability**: Firebase's enterprise-grade infrastructure
- **Features**: Built-in password reset, email verification
- **Cross-device**: Authentication works across devices

### Maintained Functionality:

- All existing app features continue to work
- User profiles preserved
- Seamless user experience
- No data loss during transition

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Email Verification

```javascript
import { sendEmailVerification } from "firebase/auth";
// Add email verification after signup
```

### 2. Social Login

```javascript
import { GoogleAuthProvider, signInWithPopup } from "firebase/auth";
// Add Google, Facebook, or other social providers
```

### 3. Firestore Integration

- Move user profiles from localStorage to Firestore
- Add real-time profile synchronization
- Enable multi-device profile access

### 4. Advanced Security

- Enable reCAPTCHA for additional security
- Set up custom security rules
- Add multi-factor authentication

## Testing Your Implementation

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:5173/auth`
3. **Test signup**: Create a new account
4. **Test login**: Log in with created credentials
5. **Test password reset**: Use "Forgot Password" feature
6. **Verify persistence**: Refresh page to confirm login state persists

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Ensure Email/Password authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
4. Check network connectivity for Firebase requests

Your application now has enterprise-grade authentication powered by Firebase! ðŸš€
